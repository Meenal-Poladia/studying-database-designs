    Introduction

    Database is something that stores data. Data can be anything. It can be contact numbers of the customers to
    ideas of a poet or an author.
    It is a base for storing data.

    Most data we see on the internet comes from the backend database. It is the database which stores our login
    credentials and helps us to visit the webpage without signing in again.

    Database helps us to run queries faster than on spreadsheet.

    Database helps us to work selectively on some data also.
