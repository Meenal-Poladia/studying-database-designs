    Relational Database

    In relational database we combine two different attributes.

    Entity is anything about which we store data and attribute is the thing that we store. For eg: Entity can be a
    person and attribute can be its name or age.

    In relational database we store data in a table.

    Entity type is the category of the entities that we are storing like Person or Caleb. Attribute type is the property
    which we are storing of the person.

    Attributes are columns and entities are individual rows. All the attributes and entities together make a table
    which has a name or is called as entity.
