/*

    Naming Convention

    For writing the queries we use capital letters. -> example 1

    We use _ instead of spaces between 2 words. -> example 2

    The name of the table is usually not written in capital letter -> example 3

    example 1
    SELECT
    CREATE
    UPDATE

    example 2
    user_name
    selected_number

    example 3
    products
    users
