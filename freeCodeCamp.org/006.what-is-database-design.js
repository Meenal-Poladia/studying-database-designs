    What is Database Design

    When we are designing database it is important to have data integrity which means all tables have the correct and
    the latest data and there is no scope of disconnected data. If there is a disconnect then if one table updates then the
    other table will not update and so the data in the other table will be not be up to date.

    There are 2-3 ways in which database design can be broken down. These are also called as schemas:
        1. Conceptual
        2. Logical
        3. Physical

    From phase 1-3 the schemas goes from being general to specific.

    Database design is a method to separate information over multiple tables rather than having one huge table where we
    store all the information.
