    Database Terms

    Data is anything which we store in the database.

    Database is the place where we store our data.

    Relational database is the way in which we store data in tables.

    DBMS is how we manage our database in the code.

    RDBMS is a way in which we control our database using relational database.

    Null is when someone does not enter a value within a column. Null means there is no data into the field.

    Anomalies are errors within our data integrity. For example We wanted to update one column but by mistake we
    updated 10 columns.

    Integrity, we implement integrity to protect against anomaly. we have 3 ways to keep integrity:
        1. Entity integrity -  having just one entity with a unique name
        2. Referential integrity - building connections across tables
        3. Domain integrity - a column within a table has all of the expected values.

    Entity is something about which we are storing information.

    Attributes are the things we store about the entity.

    Relation is a connection between two sets of data.

    Tuple/ Row are all the attributes about the entity.

    Table is a physical representation of a relation. Within a table we have rows and columns.

    File is another name for a table.

    Record is another name for a row.

    Field is another name for a column.

    Value is the information we put into a specific column.

    Database design is the process of designing your table to remove anomalies and have data integrity.

    Schema is the structure of our database.

    Normalisation are the bunch of steps we will use to get the database design.

    Naming Convention is just a consistency used to make things consistent. We name our database, schema, rows, columns
    and values in a certain way.

    Key is something to make everything unique within a table. This is how we connect tables. For example we connect
    2 tables using ids.

    Relation. table and file are all talking about the structure of the table.

    Tuple, rows, entry and record are all talking about rows within a table.

    Columns, attributes and field are all talking about the column within a table.
