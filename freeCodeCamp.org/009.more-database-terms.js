    Client-Server, the client sends request to the server and servers sends data in the form of response to the
    client.

    View is showing the data from the server in a way that it is easy for users to understand.

    Joins, views often use joins which basically connects data from multiple tables to create a new table. For example
    we have a users table and a comments table, the comments table has the comment column, user id which is the foreign
    key and the id. So, here we want to show the username and the comment rather than the user id so we use join to get
    the user name using user id from the comments table.
