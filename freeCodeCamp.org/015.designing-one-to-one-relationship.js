    Designing one to one relationship

    In one to one relationship the attribute is exclusive to the entity. The same attribute does not belong to some
    other entity.
    For example - Calab Curry can have just one SIN.

    We can have multiple one-to-one connection over different tables. For example - In one table we can store the
    card holders details and in another table store the card details. We can connect these two tables using the userId.

    In one to one table we focus on the entity model thus we save only one piece of information and store the other
    information in another table and connect the table using a foreign key.
