    Designing one to many relationship

    Example of one to many is, a user can own many cards but one card can only be owned by one user.

    Foreign key is the primary key in another table. What is unique to one table may be many in another table. In a
    parent child relationship one table which uses the primary key of another table is the foreign key in the child
    table.
