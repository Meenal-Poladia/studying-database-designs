    Parent and Child Table

    Keys connect different tables and different tables have keys which are unique to the table. What is primary key
    in one table might be a foreign key in another table.

    Primary key is with the parent and foreign key is with the child. The child inherits the values from the parent.

    In many to many relationship we have problem with the parent child relationship so we cannot store it in database.
