    Introduction to Keys

    Keys keeps everything unique. Something unique in each row which differentiates it from another is called as a key.
    For example - email id of each user will be different from one another so there is unique value in each row.

    Two similar keys should not exist in the database. Keys can be a combination of two columns.

    Key should never be changed. If the key of one table changes then we need to update the key in other connecting
    tables as well.

    Keys can never be null.

    3 important things about keys:
        1. Keys should always be unique
        2. Keys should never be changing
        3. Keys should never be null
