    SuperKey and Candidate Key

    The two main types of keys are primary keys and foreign keys.

    Superkey is any number of columns that forces the row to be unique.

    Candidate key is the least number of columns needed to force every row to be unique. Candidate keys are candidates
    for making a primary key.

    Superkey can have many cnadidate keys and other redundant keys as well.

    Candidate key is least and Superkey is any.

    For knowing if the column is a superkey we ask the question:
        1. Can every row be unique?
        2. How many columns are needed?
        3. How many CK do we have?
