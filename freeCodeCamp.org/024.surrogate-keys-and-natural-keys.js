    Surrogate Keys and Natural Keys

    Surrogate and natural keys are categories of primary keys.
    Natural keys are something we want to store naturally in the table. To add a natural key we do not have to make up
    something or add an extra  for example id.

    Surrogate keys are made up keys. They are added in our column. Surrogate keys are kept very private and no one
    knows them except for the people working with them.

    When we are building our database we see to it that we do not keep changing our approach of using a surrogate key or
    a natural key.
