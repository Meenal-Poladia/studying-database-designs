    Should I use surrogate keys or natural keys

    In natural keys, we do not manually need to define them. Surrogate keys are added manually and have no real meaning.

    It is good to have a natural key or something like a natural key to use with every table.

    Whichever key we pick we need to use it all across the database. It is not a good practise to keep changing from
    natural key to surrogate key.
