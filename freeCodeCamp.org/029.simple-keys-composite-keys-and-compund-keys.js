    Simple keys composite keys and compound keys

    Simple means the key contains of one column for example surrogate key. Composite key means the key contains of two
    or more columns. For example - natural keys are combination of two or more columns.
    Some database dont differentiate between composite and compound keys and us it interchangeably.

    Compound keys are those keys in which the table have multiple columns and they are all keys themselves. The most
    common example of this is the intermediary table.
